			Monk is a translator for all things pray.<br>
			It also supports an embedded pray template format called CAOS2PRAY.<br>
			This encodes pray data inside .cos files, eliminating the extra .txt file.<br>
			<br>
			These translations are possible:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Compiled PRAY -&gt; Pray template (.txt)</li>
				<li>Pray template -&gt; Compiled PRAY</li>
				<li>CAOS script with CAOS2PRAY -&gt; Compiled PRAY</li>
				<li>CAOS script with CAOS2PRAY -&gt; Pray template (.txt)</li>
			</ul>
