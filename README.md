# What the heck does this do?
This is a question I often ask myself of programs I have downloaded in a
frenzy and forgotten about.  And one that the Help, annoyingly, never answers.

Jagent is a suite of tools for working with Creatures Series files.
If you don't know what Creatures 3 or Docking Station are, then these
tools will be of no use to you whatsoever.

+ Edos is an Editor of Sprites.
	+ It works mostly like the old SpriteBuilder

+ Monk deals with PRAY files.
	+ Choose the output format with the radio buttons, then drop an input file on it
